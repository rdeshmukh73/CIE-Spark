    "Cost of the Problem — calculation notes ": "Assumptions:  Average college student handles 5–8 courses per semester, each with multiple assignments or exams.  Each missed or late submission may lead to a grade penalty or loss of marks (5–10%), and causes significant stress and rework.  Students typically spend 1–2 hours per week searching for deadlines scattered across WhatsApp, emails, and LMS platforms.

It guarantees accurate, end-to-end routing (from any room to any room), directly eliminating time wasted in trial-and-error wandering and removing the significant stress caused by disorientation.",
    "Next step with support (e.g., pilot plan) ": "Develop an MVP (Minimum Viable Prototype) of the web app focused on mapping one high-traffic 'hotspot' (e.g., Main Block to the Auditorium) and run a 2-week pilot with 50+ students to validate routing accuracy and gather feedback.",

      "A persistent, not urgent, quality-of-life issue on campus.",
      "Technically very solvable with modern indoor mapping and AR.",
      "Limited profitability; relies on university funding, not direct users."
