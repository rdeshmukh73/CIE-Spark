Focus Force,Divisha Gupta,"College students often miss assignment deadlines because due dates are scattered across multiple sources — originating from professors, teaching assistants, and departments through LMS platforms, emails, WhatsApp groups, notice boards, and in-class announcements.

For 5,000 users, that’s roughly ₹1.2 crore in wasted productivity and over 4,50,000 total hours lost annually — a gap Deadline Desk directly aims to close.",EdTech,24,"Most respondents rely on WhatsApp groups or LMS portals for deadlines — making it easy to miss updates.
Over 70% admitted they’ve missed or almost missed a deadline or meeting due to scattered information.
Respondents want a single, automated dashboard that gathers all tasks from multiple sources.

— Second Year College Student","TAM (Total Addressable Market): All university students and working professionals in India. India has ~38 million higher education students (as per AISHE report).
Add ~50 million working professionals who handle regular meetings and deadlines.
TAM ≈ 88 million potential users.
","Tech-savvy students and early-career professionals (urban areas) with access to digital tools like Google Calendar, LMS, and WhatsApp. Estimation: Approx. 25% of the TAM actively uses digital productivity or calendar tools. SAM ≈ 22 million users.","For the initial launch, the focus will be on students and professionals within our own college network. With around 5,000–10,000 potential users on campus (including students, clubs, and faculty), this forms a practical and achievable target group for testing, feedback, and early adoption before expanding to nearby institutions.","Assumptions:  Average college student handles 5–8 courses per semester, each with multiple assignments or exams.  Each missed or late submission may lead to a grade penalty or loss of marks (5–10%), and causes significant stress and rework.  Students typically spend 1–2 hours per week searching for deadlines scattered across WhatsApp, emails, and LMS platforms.  Missed deadlines can also impact academic performance, attendance, and reputation in group work or internships. Data Sources:  Informal survey and feedback from classmates (5–6 students over a 7-day testing period) as described in the prototype plan.

2) Add tasks manually in Google Calendar or the phone’s built-in calendar.
3) Scroll through WhatsApp messages or LMS platforms to find deadlines.
4) Depend on friends or group chats to be reminded of upcoming due dates.","1) Manual methods are easy to forget, misplace, or overlook, especially during busy weeks.
2) Calendar tools require manual entry and don’t sync automatically with LMS or chats.
3) Searching chats or LMS posts is inefficient. Deadlines get buried under unrelated messages.
4) Relying on others is unreliable and inconsistent, as peers may also forget or miss updates.","There’s no unified, automated system that collects deadlines and meetings from multiple sources (LMS, WhatsApp, email) and organizes them in one dashboard with smart reminders and sync which is affordable, reliable, and easy to use.",9,"Scaled Impact: For just 1% of our target market (6M users), the problem wastes ~1.25 billion hours and ~$35 billion annually.
