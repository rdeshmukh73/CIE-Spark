Netflix,"Movie lovers face major inconvenience in accessing the films and TV shows they want. Physical rentals are often unavailable, costly, and time-consuming, while television schedules are rigid and lack viewer control.","Proposed Solution Direction:
A digital streaming platform that allows users to instantly watch movies and TV shows online, anytime,
without downloads or physical media.

Zomato,"High user drop-off occurs when customers switch from
browsing and discovery on the platform to placing an order, caused by a disconnect
between the dining-out experience and the food delivery service.","Proposed Solution Direction: A context-aware ""Smart Nudge"" feature that, upon
detecting a user browsing a restaurant's dining-in profile, dynamically presents a
non-intrusive, compelling offer or call-to-action to order delivery from that same

converting discovery intent into transactional action, increasing delivery order volume

delivery information to generate optimized, hyperlocal routes specifically for two-wheeler
fleets.
