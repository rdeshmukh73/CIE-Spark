      "\t The country faces a significant challenge in the timely and accurate diagnosis of skin conditions. Many people experience delays in receiving a proper diagnosis due to limited access to dermatologists, especially in remote areas, and the inconsistent quality of diagnostic tools across different healthcare facilities. This issue is further compounded by a lack of affordable access to medicines. This leads to increased anxiety, potential for misdiagnosis, and the exacerbation of skin conditions, which can result in medical emergencies. The primary stakeholders affected are individuals experiencing skin issues, their families, and the healthcare system as a whole. However, the effectiveness of any solution is limited by factors such as affordability for all, the reliability of diagnostic technologies, and the infrastructural capacity of hospitals.
