    "### Key Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture:**\n",
    "- Each evaluation criterion gets a separate, independent API call\n",
    "- No context is maintained between different criteria evaluations\n",
    "- Each call creates a fresh chat session\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rate Limiting Strategy:**\n",
    "1. Configurable delay between each API call (default: 1s)\n",
    "2. Additional delay between processing different teams (default: 2s)\n",
    "3. Retry logic with backoff for failed requests\n",
    "4. Progress tracking with detailed logging\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Resilient**: If one criterion fails, others continue\n",
    "- ✅ **Transparent**: Clear progress tracking and error reporting\n",
    "- ✅ **Configurable**: Easy to adjust rate limits based on API quotas\n",
    "- ✅ **Scalable**: Can be extended to parallel processing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trade-offs:**\n",
    "- ⚠️ May use more tokens than multi-turn approach (no context sharing)\n",
    "- ⚠️ Takes longer due to rate limiting delays\n",
    "- ⚠️ No semantic connection between criterion evaluations"
